# Matrix Calculator
This matrix calculator makes basic matrix calculations using algorithms and methods
taught in a Linear Algebra course I took.

## Motivation
I created this program to help my friend understand the steps in finding a solution
to a matrix/system of linear equations. I continued working on this project to add more
features to make other matrix calculations!

## How to Run
- Download an IDE or have some method to run Python files
  (I suggest VSCode or IDLE as they are very easy to use!)
- Download and place the "matrix.py" file in a directory that you
  can easily access
- Run "matrix.py" in the IDE
- Follow the program's instructions and find your calculations

## What is Included?
- Solving the Matrix(Finds RREF as well as shows steps)
- Adding Matrices
- Subtracting Matrices
- Multiplying Matrices
- Calculating the Determinant
- Calculating the Inverse

## Anything planned for the Future?
Here are a few things I am working on adding to the calculator:
- Showing steps in calculating the determinant
- Matrix Division? (There isn't any matrix division, but it would be similar to multiplying
an inverse of a matrix to another matrix)
- Other Suggestions others may think should be included!
