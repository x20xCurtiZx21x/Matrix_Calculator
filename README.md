# Matrix Calculator
This matrix calculator makes basic matrix calculations using algorithms and methods
taught in a Linear Algebra course I took.

## General Information

### Motivation
I created this program to help my friend understand the steps in finding a solution
to a matrix/system of linear equations. I continued working on this project to add more
features to make other matrix calculations!

### Functionality
- Solving the Matrix(Finds RREF as well as shows steps)
- Adding Matrices
- Subtracting Matrices
- Multiplying Matrices
- Calculating the Determinant
- Calculating the Inverse
- Transposing the Matrix
- Calculating Eigenvalues(Only for 2x2 Matrix Currently)
- Calculating Eigenvectors(Only for 2x2 Matrix Currently)

### Future Plans
Here are a few things I am working on adding to the calculator:
- Matrix Division? (Matrix division isn't really a thing, but it would be similar to multiplying
an inverse of a matrix to another matrix)
- Creating a better function to calculate any square matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Touch up stuff, such as fixing typos and simplifying code
- Working on recreating the calculator in other programming languages
- Other suggestions others may think should be included!

## Setup

### Technologies
This program was created with:
- Python 3.10.11

### Running the Program:
- Download and place the "matrix.py" file in a directory that you
  can easily access
- To run the program:
```
$ cd ../"matrix_calc"
$ python matrix.py
```
(Note: "matrix_calc" is a placeholder for the directory you choose to place matrix.py in)
- Follow the program's instructions and find your calculations
- You could also run the program in an IDE. If this is the case, I
suggest VSCode or IDLE. To run it, select the file in the IDE and
click run
